## More Information

Using the Web Shortcuts API, PWAs can tie into the shortcuts UI in Windows, enabling users to jump to specific pages or actions in your PWA! This can be useful for scenarios like:

Mail Applications, as you can let users jump straight to writing a new email from a right click on your app icon in the start menu and taskbar!
Social Media Apps such as Twitter, which enables users to jump straight into creating a tweet, the notifications screen, reading their DMs and more, all from a right click of the Twitter icon.
