# PWABuilder Android platform documentation

The PWABuilder Android platform utilizes the [open source Bubblerwrap tool](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap) to generate a [Trusted Web Activity](https://developers.google.com/web/android/trusted-web-activity/) (TWA) that can be installed on the Google Play Store. This TWA behaves like any other Android application and is a great way to ship your PWA to the Google Play Store.

2. [Testing and publishing your your app to the Google Play Store](/docs/android/next-steps-documentation/)
